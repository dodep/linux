terminal = tty = text input/output environment
console = physical terminal
shell = command line interpreter

Terminal: the text interface to the shell program, can't do anything on its own apart from giving input to the shell and displaying output from shell
Shell: a program that processes commands and returns an output
 i.e. terminal runs a shell
Bash is a type of shell program (or shell language). Bash and shell aren't synonymous 
 Command line is just a style of user interface that requires users to type in commands to get the computer to do stuff as opposed to e.g. a graphical user interface where the user clicks.
 A console is supposed to be the physical monitor and keyboard setup that is running a terminal that the user types commands into but in essence it is just a terminal
