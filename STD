Each file associated with a process is allocated a unique number to identify it. This is known as the file descriptor. Whenever an action is required to be performed on a file, the file descriptor is used to identify the file.

These values are always used for stdin, stdout, and stderr:

0: stdin
1: stdout
2: stderr

WRITE

$ pwd > pwd.txt

OR

APPEND

$ pwd >> pwd.txt
 
STDERR
$ cd NONE 2>> error.txt
